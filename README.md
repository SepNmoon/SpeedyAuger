#### 1. Project Description
SpeedyAuger is a software helps experimenter to calculate Auger transitions for elements with atomic number 3 to 93.

#### 4. Introduce Function

* Root Window
![root](https://github.com/SepNmoon/Auger_Software/blob/master/image/root_window.JPG)
Open the SpeedyAuger, user can see the root window.


* Auger Transition for Each Element  
To calculate the Auger energies for each element, just click the corresponding element button. 
For example: 5 B  
![click_element](https://github.com/SepNmoon/Auger_Software/blob/master/image/click_element.JPG)
Then, a new window pops up
![Auger_transition](https://github.com/SepNmoon/Auger_Software/blob/master/image/Auger_transition.JPG)
The right table shows all possible Auger transitions and energies for B.  
The Auger transitions are calculated using the methods outlined by W. A. Coghlan and R.E. Clausing [1].


* Convert Kinetic Energy to Binding Energy  
User can select or enter photon energy to convert kinetic energy of Auger transition to binding energy. Export button helps user to export the table to a txt file. 
![convert_function](https://github.com/SepNmoon/Auger_Software/blob/master/image/convert_function.JPG)
![export_auger_table](https://github.com/SepNmoon/Auger_Software/blob/master/image/export_auger_table.JPG)


* Show Core Energy for Each Element  
To get the core state binding energies for each element, click the corresponding element. 
For example: 5 B
The left table shows the core energies for each subshell of B. 
![core_energies](https://github.com/SepNmoon/Auger_Software/blob/master/image/core_energies.JPG)


* Search Function  
Go back the the root window, user can search Auger transitions and core energies in a specified range. 
   - Search Auger Transition
![search_auger](https://github.com/SepNmoon/Auger_Software/blob/master/image/search_auger.JPG)  
Enter the search range firstly, then select Auger transitions option. User can select search from all elements or some specified elements as well.
![select_elements](https://github.com/SepNmoon/Auger_Software/blob/master/image/select_elements.JPG)
The combobx and entry pop up for user to select or enter photon energy when select search by binding energy. Finally, click search button.

    - Search Core State Energies
![search_core](https://github.com/SepNmoon/Auger_Software/blob/master/image/search_core.JPG)  
Enter the search range firstly, then select Auger transitions option. User can select search from all elements or some specified elements as well.
The combobx and entry pop up for user to select or enter photon energy when select search by kinetic energy. Finally, click search button.

    - Search Auger and Core Energy Together  
![search_both](https://github.com/SepNmoon/Auger_Software/blob/master/image/search_both.JPG)
As shown in the figure, user selects 'Both' for the first option, then select elements and photon energy. Finally, click search button.

    - Search Window  
After clicking the search button, the program opens a new window which contains a table. 
![search_window](https://github.com/SepNmoon/Auger_Software/blob/master/image/search_window.JPG)
The table shows Auger or core energies in the search range. Three buttons provide three ways to sort table data. Export button helps user to import the table to txt file.


* Plot Function
    - Plot Auger and Core Lines for Each Element
The program can plot Auger lines and core lines with energies and normalized intensity.  
![plot_each](https://github.com/SepNmoon/Auger_Software/blob/master/image/plot_each.JPG)  
For example: 5 B  
User can select the value of photon energy and x axis (BE vs KE). Finally, click plot button.
![plot_figure1](https://github.com/SepNmoon/Auger_Software/blob/master/image/plot_figure1.JPG)  
Auger line intensities were calculated using the 'normalized multiplicity" method outlined by W. A. Coghlan and R.E. Clausing [1].  
Core line intensities are scaled according to their photoionisation cross section value at the given photon energy. The implemented photoionisation cross section data was taken from the digitised version of the Scofield Cross Section tabulated data [2,3].

    - Plot Imported Dataset  
Go back to the root window, the program allows user to import dataset they measured, and plot the data and reference lines.
 ![plot_data](https://github.com/SepNmoon/Auger_Software/blob/master/image/plot_data.JPG)  
 User needs to import data file, select photon energy and elements, and the range of x axis.
 ![plot_figure2](https://github.com/SepNmoon/Auger_Software/blob/master/image/plot_figure2.JPG)
     
     - Plot Reference Lines for a Number of Selected Elements  
Go back to the root window, user selects elements and photon energy, click plot button directly without import files.
#### 5. Calculation
* Auger Energies:  
  E_vxy=E_v-E_x'-E_y' [1]  
  where E_v is the core state binding energy of the fist electron ejected from the inner shell.   
  E_x'=[E_x(Z)+E_x(Z+1)]/2, E_y'=[E_y(Z)+E_y(Z+1)]/2. E_x(Z) and E_x(Z+1) are the binding energies of x shell in atoms whose atom number is Z and Z+1. E_y(Z) and E_y(Z+1) have the similar meaning for y shell.

* Norm Multiplicity  
  ‘Normalized multiplicity’ is a method to calculate relative Auger intensities by multiplying the number of electrons in the subshells involved in transitions, and normalize these quantities to maximum of 100 for the largest product for a specific element [1].
